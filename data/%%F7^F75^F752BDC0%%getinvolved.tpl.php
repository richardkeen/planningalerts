    <p>PlanningAlerts.com is run by volunteers. If you would like to get involved we'd love to here from you:</p>

    <h3>I am a programmer and want to add my local authority</h3>
    <p>
        You can help by writing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_scraping">screen scraper</a> for your local authority that was can import into plannignalerts.com. There are only 2 criteria for the screen scraper:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>That it can output data in the following format: <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com/lambeth.xml">http://www.planningalerts.com/lambeth.xml</a></li>
        <li>That it can accept a query sting in the format day=X&month=Y&year=Z</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
       Other than that it's up to you. It can be in any language. You can host them yourself or we can host it for you.
    </p>

    <h3>I work for a local authority and would like to make our data available</h3>
    <p>
        The most important thing you can do is publish your data in a simple format that is freely available on the internet. Something <a href="/lambeth.xml">like this</a> is good but we can work with most formats. Please <a href="/about.php#contact">get in touch</a> if you would like to discuss how you can help.
    </p>
