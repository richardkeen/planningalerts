In order to generate the contents of the CGI directory (../cgi-bin/)
run

./createCGI.sh

This script generates new cgi files in the CGI directory,
copies in some other files that are needed,
and commits all these changes to svn.

There is currently something very nasty in the permissions
column in the file OtherFilesToCopy.csv

Until version 2.6 of python, there appears to be no convenient
way to convert a string like 0755 into an octal. I am therefore
using integers to specify permissions of the copied files...

420 is 0644
493 is 0755

This is horrid, and must change in the future...
