In order to install this lot:

Make sure you are in a nice clean fresh svn export, by doing:

svn export http://planningalerts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ planningalerts

If deployment_script.svn has changed, you'll need to merge the changes into
your local copy. In particular, make sure that line 1 of the file points to
the correct path for bash.

Then all you need to do is run:

./deployment_script
