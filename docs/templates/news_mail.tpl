Hello,

We don't normally ask anything of people signed up to PlanningAlerts, but hopefully you'll excuse a one off cheeky request for help.

Planning Alerts has continued to grow with more councils added, and more and more people signing up to use it. This is really great, and people continue to tell us that they like the service, which is always nice to hear.

But we've reached the point where we need to move to a bigger server, and that is going to cost us money. So we were wondering if you would consider donating to a small amount to help us out?

You can donate here:

Since it seems unfair to ask for money and not do anything in return, if we raise enough money to pay for a new server, we'll promise to make a start at including Licensing Applications (new pubs, off licenses etc) in our emails. If that seems like a fair deal, please click on the link above.

Thanks and all the best,

Richard & Duncan (PlanningAlerts.com volunteers)
