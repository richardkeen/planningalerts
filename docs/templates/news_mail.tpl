Hello,

This is a one-off email to let you know about a new website I've built that's a bit like Planning Alerts: http://www.streetwire.org

StreetWire is like PlanningAlerts for every kind of local information. As well as planning applications, it will tell you about licensing applications, crime, events and local news near you.

You can also share news with your neighbours, so if you know some little titbit of local news, or want to tell people about an event, it helps connect you with your local community.

You can sign-up here:

http://www.streetwire.org

I hope you find this useful. It would be really great to hear what you think of it, and what sort of information you'd like to see.

All the best,

Richard Pope (volunteer PlanningAlerts.com)
