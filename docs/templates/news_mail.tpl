Hello,

This is a one off email to let you know about a new website I've built on top of PlanningAlerts: http://www.streetwire.org

StreetWire is like PlanningAlerts for every kind of local information. As well as planning applications, it will tell you about licensing applications, crime, events and local news near you.

You can also share news with your neighbours, so If you know some little tipbit of local news, or want to tell your neighbours about an event it helps connect you with your neighbours.

You can signup here:

http://www.streetwire.org

I hope it's useful, it would be really great to here what everyone things of it, and what sort of information you'd like to see.

All the best,

Richard Pope (volunteer PlanningAlerts.com)
